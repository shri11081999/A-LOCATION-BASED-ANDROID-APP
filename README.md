# üìç Location-Based Android Application Using ArcGIS Maps API

This project is an **Android Application** built using the **ArcGIS Maps API**. The application provides users with a personalized map experience, allowing them to explore and stay updated on various points of interest (POIs) based on their location. This project demonstrates the use of **parallel computing** and **multithreading** to efficiently fetch, display, and update data from ArcGIS servers in real-time, providing a seamless user experience.

## üéØ Objective

The primary goal of this project is to create a **location-based Android application** that allows users to explore points of interest (POIs) such as restaurants, ATMs, hospitals, and more. By using the **ArcGIS Maps API**, the app provides a dynamic map that updates in real-time based on the user's preferences and location.

## üåü Key Features

- **Real-Time POI Updates**: Fetch and display points of interest near the user in real-time.
- **Customizable Map Experience**: Users can choose their categories of interest (e.g., ATMs, restaurants) and control the map update frequency.
- **Favorite Places**: Users can mark certain locations as favorites for quick access later.
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficiently handle tasks such as data fetching and map updating using parallel computing and multithreading techniques.
- **Offline Functionality**: The app continues to display cached map data even when the user is offline.

üöÄ Getting Started
